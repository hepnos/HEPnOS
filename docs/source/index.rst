Welcome to the HEPnOS project
=============================

HEPnOS is an transient, in-memory, distributed storage system for
high energy physics (HEP) workflows running on supercomputers.
It is based on software components fron the
`Mochi project <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mochi/>`_
and was designed in the context of the
`SciDAC-4 "HEP on HPC" <https://computing.fnal.gov/hep-on-hpc/>`_
collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory and FermiLab.

This website gathers documentation and tutorials on how to install
it and use it.
